Thank you for providing the specific file structure for **Assignment 6: Discuss DevOps Tools and Their Practical Implementation**. I’ll create the content for the four requested files in the `Question6/` folder, following your structure (`SoftwareEngineeringAssignments/Question6/`):
- `DevOpsTools.md`: A Markdown file explaining the purpose, core features, and use cases of Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes, with references to the example configurations.
- `Jenkinsfile`: A Jenkins pipeline script for a CI/CD pipeline.
- `Dockerfile`: A Docker configuration to containerize a Java application.
- `deployment.yaml`: A Kubernetes configuration to deploy the containerized app.

Each file will be wrapped in an `<xaiArtifact>` tag with a unique UUID, as these are new artifacts. The content will be clear, professional, and submission-ready, aligning with the evaluation criteria (documentation and implementation). I’ll include instructions for setting up and running the examples, considering your setup (VS Code, Git, JDK 17+). After completing Assignment 6, I’ll await your instruction to proceed to the next assignment or address any feedback.

# DevOps Tools: Purpose, Features, and Practical Implementation

This document explores three DevOps tools—Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes—covering their purpose, core features, and practical use cases in a CI/CD pipeline. Each tool is demonstrated with an example configuration: `Jenkinsfile` for Jenkins, `Dockerfile` for Docker, and `deployment.yaml` for Kubernetes.

## 1. Jenkins – Continuous Integration and Automation Server

### Purpose
Jenkins is an open-source automation server that facilitates continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD). It automates repetitive tasks like building, testing, and deploying code, improving software delivery speed and reliability.

### Core Features
- **Pipeline Support**: Define CI/CD workflows using a `Jenkinsfile` with declarative or scripted syntax.
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Over 1,800 plugins for integration with tools like Git, Docker, and Kubernetes.
- **Scalability**: Supports distributed builds via a master-agent architecture.
- **Extensibility**: Customizable through plugins and scripts for various workflows.

### Practical Use Cases
- Automating build and test cycles for Java projects after commits.
- Deploying applications to staging environments post-build.
- Triggering Kubernetes deployments after successful tests.

### Example
The `Jenkinsfile` in this folder defines a pipeline that:
1. Checks out code from a Git repository.
2. Builds a Java project using Maven.
3. Runs unit tests.
4. Builds a Docker image using the `Dockerfile`.
5. Pushes the image to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
This pipeline demonstrates a CI workflow that can be extended for CD by integrating with Kubernetes.

## 2. Docker – Containerization Platform

### Purpose
Docker is a platform for building, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers bundle an application with its dependencies, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

### Core Features
- **Containerization**: Creates isolated, lightweight containers from Docker images.
- **Dockerfile**: Defines image creation steps (e.g., base image, app files, runtime commands).
- **Docker Hub**: A registry for sharing and storing Docker images.
- **Portability**: Runs consistently on any system with Docker installed.

### Practical Use Cases
- Creating consistent development environments for team collaboration.
- Packaging microservices for independent deployment.
- Running CI/CD pipeline stages in isolated containers.

### Example
The `Dockerfile` in this folder builds a container for a Java application by:
1. Using OpenJDK 17 as the base image.
2. Copying a compiled JAR file into the container.
3. Running the JAR when the container starts.
This container can be built and pushed by Jenkins, then deployed with Kubernetes.

## 3. Kubernetes – Container Orchestration System

### Purpose
Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It orchestrates containers across a cluster, ensuring reliability and scalability.

### Core Features
- **Pod Management**: Groups containers into pods, the smallest deployable units.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across pods using services.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Adjusts the number of pods based on demand (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler).
- **Self-Healing**: Restarts failed containers and reschedules pods to maintain desired state.

### Practical Use Cases
- Deploying multi-container applications in production.
- Managing rolling updates for zero-downtime deployments.
- Scaling web applications during high traffic (e.g., university event registration).

### Example
The `deployment.yaml` in this folder deploys the Dockerized Java app to Kubernetes by:
1. Defining a deployment with 2 replicas for redundancy.
2. Specifying the Docker image to use.
3. Exposing the app via a LoadBalancer service.
This setup integrates with a CI/CD pipeline where Jenkins pushes a new image, and Kubernetes performs a rolling update.

## Conclusion
- **Jenkins**: Automates CI/CD pipelines, integrating with Docker and Kubernetes for seamless workflows.
- **Docker**: Ensures environment consistency by containerizing applications.
- **Kubernetes**: Manages and scales containerized apps in production.
Together, these tools enable a robust CI/CD pipeline, as shown in the examples, making them essential for modern DevOps practices.
