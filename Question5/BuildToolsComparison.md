Thank you for confirming we should proceed to **Assignment 5: Compare and Contrast Build Automation Tools with Examples**. I’ll create the content for this assignment in the `Question5/` folder, following your assignment-based structure (`SoftwareEngineeringAssignments/Question5/`). The task requires comparing Maven, Gradle, and Ant based on architecture, ease of configuration, performance, flexibility, and ecosystem, and providing a basic example or build script for each. I’ll produce two files:
- `Question5/BuildToolsComparison.md`: A Markdown file with the comparison and examples.
- `Question5/build_scripts/`: A subfolder containing example build scripts (`pom.xml` for Maven, `build.gradle` for Gradle, `build.xml` for Ant).

Each file will be wrapped in an `<xaiArtifact>` tag with a unique UUID, as these are new artifacts. I’ll ensure the content is clear, professional, and submission-ready, aligning with the evaluation criteria (documentation and implementation). Instructions for setting up and running the examples will be included, considering your existing setup (VS Code, Git, JDK 17+). After completing Assignment 5, I’ll await your instruction to proceed to Assignment 6.

# Comparison of Build Automation Tools: Maven, Gradle, and Ant

This document compares three popular build automation tools—Maven, Gradle, and Ant—in terms of architecture, ease of configuration, performance, flexibility, and ecosystem. Each tool is demonstrated with a basic build script to compile and run a simple Java project. The examples are located in the `build_scripts/` subfolder.

## Comparison

| **Aspect**            | **Maven**                              | **Gradle**                            | **Ant**                               |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Architecture**      | Based on a fixed Project Object Model (POM). Centralized configuration with a rigid structure (e.g., `src/main/java`, `target/`). | Uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for task dependencies. Flexible directory structure. | Task-based with XML scripts. No inherent structure; fully manual configuration. |
| **Ease of Configuration** | Easy for standard projects with predefined conventions. Requires learning POM XML syntax. | Highly configurable with Groovy/Kotlin DSL. Steeper learning curve but more intuitive. | Complex due to verbose XML; requires manual task definition. Steepest learning curve. |
| **Performance**       | Moderate. Builds can be slow due to XML parsing and fixed lifecycle phases. | High. Incremental builds and parallel execution improve speed. | Moderate. Depends on script efficiency; no built-in optimization. |
| **Flexibility**       | Limited by convention-over-configuration. Hard to customize beyond standard workflows. | Very flexible. Supports custom tasks and integrates with other tools easily. | Highly flexible but requires manual scripting for each task. |
| **Ecosystem**         | Rich ecosystem with extensive plugins (e.g., JUnit, Spring). Widely adopted in enterprise Java. | Growing ecosystem with Gradle Plugin Portal. Popular in Android and modern Java. | Smaller ecosystem; relies on community tasks. Less maintained today. |

## Detailed Comparison

### Architecture
- **Maven**: Uses a POM (Project Object Model) defined in `pom.xml`. Follows a standardized directory layout (e.g., `src/main/java` for source code, `target/` for outputs). The build process is divided into phases (e.g., compile, test, package).
- **Gradle**: Employs a DAG to manage task dependencies, allowing dynamic task execution. Directory structure is customizable, making it adaptable to various project types.
- **Ant**: Task-driven with no predefined structure. Uses `build.xml` to define targets (e.g., compile, jar), requiring manual setup for each project.

### Ease of Configuration
- **Maven**: Simplifies setup for typical Java projects with conventions (e.g., default dependency management). However, customizing beyond defaults requires XML edits, which can be verbose.
- **Gradle**: Offers a DSL based on Groovy or Kotlin, providing a programmatic and readable configuration. Initial setup may require learning, but it’s more maintainable long-term.
- **Ant**: Requires writing detailed XML scripts for every task (e.g., compiling, copying files), making it labor-intensive and error-prone.

### Performance
- **Maven**: Performs moderately due to XML parsing and sequential phase execution. Recent versions support parallel builds with configuration.
- **Gradle**: Excels with incremental builds (only changed files are recompiled) and parallel task execution, optimizing performance for large projects.
- **Ant**: Performance depends on script efficiency. Lacks built-in optimization, so it can be slower for complex builds.

### Flexibility
- **Maven**: Rigid due to its convention-over-configuration approach. Customization is possible but often requires plugins or workarounds.
- **Gradle**: Highly flexible with custom tasks and plugins, suitable for diverse project needs (e.g., Java, Android, multi-module).
- **Ant**: Fully flexible as it’s a generic build tool, but this comes at the cost of manual effort for each configuration.

### Ecosystem
- **Maven**: Extensive plugin support (e.g., for JUnit, Hibernate) and a large community, especially in enterprise Java (e.g., Spring Boot).
- **Gradle**: Growing ecosystem with the Gradle Plugin Portal, widely used in Android development and modern Java projects.
- **Ant**: Smaller ecosystem with fewer modern plugins; largely superseded by Maven and Gradle but still used in legacy projects.

## Examples

### Maven Example
- **File**: `build_scripts/pom.xml`
- **Purpose**: Compiles and packages a simple Java project.
- **Script**:
  ```xml
  <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
      <groupId>com.example</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-demo</artifactId>
      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      <build>
          <sourceDirectory>src/main/java</sourceDirectory>
          <plugins>
              <plugin>
                  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                  <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                  <version>3.10.1</version>
                  <configuration>
                      <source>17</source>
                      <target>17</target>
                  </configuration>
              </plugin>
          </plugins>
      </build>
  </project>
  ```
- **Usage**: Create `src/main/java/Hello.java` with `public class Hello { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println("Hello, Maven!"); } }`. Run `mvn package` in `Question5/build_scripts/`, then `java -cp target/maven-demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar Hello`.

### Gradle Example
- **File**: `build_scripts/build.gradle`
- **Purpose**: Builds a Java project with a custom task.
- **Script**:
  ```groovy
  apply plugin: 'java'

  sourceCompatibility = 17
  targetCompatibility = 17

  repositories {
      mavenCentral()
  }

  task hello(type: JavaExec) {
      main = 'Hello'
      classpath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath
  }
  ```
- **Usage**: Create `src/main/java/Hello.java` as above. Run `gradle hello` in `Question5/build_scripts/`.

### Ant Example
- **File**: `build_scripts/build.xml`
- **Purpose**: Compiles and runs a Java file.
- **Script**:
  ```xml
  <project name="ant-demo" default="run" basedir=".">
      <property name="src" location="src/main/java"/>
      <property name="build" location="build"/>

      <target name="init">
          <mkdir dir="${build}"/>
      </target>

      <target name="compile" depends="init">
          <javac srcdir="${src}" destdir="${build}" includeantruntime="false">
              <compilerarg value="-source=17"/>
              <compilerarg value="-target=17"/>
          </javac>
      </target>

      <target name="run" depends="compile">
          <java classname="Hello" classpath="${build}"/>
      </target>
  </project>
  ```
- **Usage**: Create `src/main/java/Hello.java` as above. Run `ant run` in `Question5/build_scripts/`.

## Practical Scenarios
- **Maven**: Ideal for enterprise Java projects with standard structures (e.g., Spring Boot applications).
- **Gradle**: Best for Android or multi-module projects requiring flexibility (e.g., large-scale university projects).
- **Ant**: Suitable for legacy systems or custom builds where full control is needed.

## Conclusion
- **Maven**: Best for simplicity and convention, with a robust ecosystem.
- **Gradle**: Excels in performance and flexibility, ideal for modern projects.
- **Ant**: Useful for legacy or highly customized builds but less practical today.
For academic assignments, Maven or Gradle is recommended due to their active support and ease of use with modern Java.
